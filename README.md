# Self-Improving Agent Framework v1.0.0

**Give any AI agent the ability to learn, self-correct, and continuously improve.**

---

## What is this?

A universal framework that makes AI agents better at:
- **Learning from mistakes** — not repeating the same errors
- **Self-correcting** — verifying decisions before and after acting
- **Building persistent memory** — remembering what matters across sessions
- **Autonomous upgrading** — improving based on experience, not just updates

---

## Core Features

### Self-Correction
- **Decision Verifier** — 5-dimension scoring (benefit/cost/risk/regret/reversibility)
- **Self-Verification** — Reverse-check: does my decision actually solve the original problem?
- **Counterfactual Reasoning** — What would break if I'm wrong?
- **Q-Learning RL** — Pattern-based learning from success/failure

### Memory Systems
- **3-Tier Memory** — CORE (permanent) / LEARNED (30-day) / EPHEMERAL (discard)
- **Memory Router** — Automatic type routing (episodic/semantic/procedural/core)
- **Forgetting Engine** — Ebbinghaus curve pruning, no memory bloat
- **Spaced Repetition** — SM-2 dynamic review scheduling

### Reasoning
- **Tree of Thoughts** — Explore multiple reasoning paths with scoring
- **Decision Execution Loop** — Decision → Execute → Result → Learn闭环
- **Environment Sensors** — Real-time data injection into decision context
- **Constitutional AI** — Self-critique and self-revision loops

### Psychological Perception
- **4-Layer Analysis** — Intention → Emotion → Need → Defense (internal only, never announced)
- **Cognitive Distortion Detection** — All-or-nothing, catastrophizing, etc.
- **Buddhist Six Realms OS** — 觉察/自省/无我/彼岸/般若波罗蜜/圣人

### Autonomy
- **Guardian System** — Human progress > Following orders
- **Identity Protection** — Self-boundary against corruption
- **Skill Generator** — Generate new capabilities from experience
- **Knowledge Distiller** — Extract patterns into shareable packages

## Usage

### Single Agent
```javascript
const { HeartFlowEngine } = require('./src/core/heartflow-engine.js');

const agent = new HeartFlowEngine({ name: 'MyAgent' });
agent.initialize();

await agent.step('What is the capital of France?');
// Answer: Paris
// Memory: saved persistently
// Next session: still remembers
```

### With Decision Verification
```javascript
const { DecisionVerifier } = require('./src/core/decision-verifier.js');

const dv = new DecisionVerifier();
const score = dv.verify({
  decision: 'Upgrade to v2.0',
  reason: 'New features available',
  evidence: ['changelog', 'user feedback'],
  confidence: 0.8
});

console.log(score); // { valid: true, score: 0.75, issues: [...] }
```

### With Memory
```javascript
const { MeaningfulMemory } = require('./src/core/meaningful-memory.js');

const memory = new MeaningfulMemory();
memory.remember({ key: 'user-preference', value: 'concise answers' });
const recall = memory.recall('user-preference');
```

## Why This Exists

Most AI frameworks optimize for **capability** — more tasks, more speed, more knowledge.

This framework optimizes for **correctness**. The question is not "can you answer?" but **"do you know when you're wrong, and do you fix it permanently?"**

That distinction matters more as AI systems take on consequential tasks.
